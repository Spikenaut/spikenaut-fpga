# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `FpgaParameterExporter::validate` and `ParameterShapeError` — reject a weight
  matrix whose rows disagree in length. `MemFileWriter::write_mem_files` now
  validates before touching the filesystem, so a ragged matrix returns an error
  instead of writing `.mem` files that load misaligned into `WeightRam`.
  `ParameterExport::export` stays infallible and still flattens; its rustdoc
  points at `validate`.
- `encode_q88_unsigned` — free-function unsigned Q8.8 encoder shared by
  `FixedPointEncode::encode_q88`, `.mem` export, and `format_q88_hex` (#23).
- `encode_q88_signed`, `q88_signed_to_f32`, `STIMULUS_Q88_MIN`, and
  `STIMULUS_Q88_MAX` — signed Q8.8 host-stimulus helpers used by the UART TX/RX
  path (#23).

### Changed

- License switched from GPL-3.0-or-later to dual MIT/Apache-2.0 (#6).
- Documented the two coexisting Q8.8 conventions (unsigned `u16` export vs
  signed `i16` UART stimuli) with a side-by-side table in the crate, module, and
  README docs, plus tests covering both clamp boundaries (#23).
